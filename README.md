# CS330_Comp_Graphic_Visulatization

1)How do I approach designing software?
    * What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        In this project I learned to design 3d graphical interfaces. I learned to implement algorithms for rendering and manipulating 3d objects. 
    * What design process did you follow for your project work?
        The design process I used was to first gather the requirements for the project. Once that was complete, I used an iterative approach that allowed me to              design while getting constant feedback and testing of my code. 
    * How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        In the future these tactics can help me sucessfully complete difficult projects. By breaking the projects down into smaller sub projects and constantly              testing and developing the work, I can complete the project one small  bite at at time. 
        
2) How do I approach developing programs?
    * What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        To work on this scene I first had to learn to work with new libraries and frameworks mainly OpenGL. Then I had to implement object oriented design                   principles for organizing the code. 
    * How did iteration factor into your development?
        Iterating allowed me to make incremental improvements to my design. It allowed me to get constant feedback and testing of the code I developed. It also              allowed me to design the project in an agile manner where features were developed in short cycles and refined quickly until we got a good product.    
    * How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        Throught this project I gained a deeper undertanding of requirements and constraints. I learned how to refine my coding techniques. It has also allowed me           to be understand how to work with different libraries and frameworks, how to research the libraries to ensure I am using them properly as well. 
3) How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        It provides a hands on experience with programming and development in real world scenarios. This class will allow me to explore more complex projects in             this field, and many others.      
    * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        It allows me to create immersive user experiences. It also opens opportunites in fields such as gaming, virtual reality, augmented reality, and many more.
